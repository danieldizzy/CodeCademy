    "# Number Guess\n",
    "Wanna play a game? In this project, we'll build a program that rolls a pair of dice and asks the user to guess a number. Based on the user's guess, the program should determine a winner. If the user's guess is greater than the total value of the dice roll, they win! Otherwise, the computer wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly roll a pair of dice\n",
    "2. Add the values of the roll\n",
    "3. Ask the user to guess a number\n",
    "4. Compare the user's guess to the total value\n",
    "5. Decide a winner (the user or the program)\n",
    "6. Inform the user who the winner is\n",
    " \tLet's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1. Remember, it's helpful to let other developers know what your program does. Begin by including a multi-line comment that starts on line 1 that describes what your program does. You can use the instructions above to help you write the comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t2. Since the program will roll dice, we need to make sure that the rolls are random. To do so, we will need some Python code that isn't built-in or readily available to us. Thankfully, we can import the module that will help us. Somewhere after your multi-line comment, write the following line of code.\n",
    "\t3. You'll also need to import more Python code that will be used to simulate dice rolling. On the next line, type:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from random import randint\n",
    "from time import sleep\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t4. Great! We've imported the code we'll need. We won't use it for now, but we will need it later, so let's move on. First, we'll have to prompt the user for their guess. Begin by creating a function called get_user_guess(). The function should take no arguments.\n",
    "\t5. Inside of the function, prompt the user for their guess. Store the input into a variable called user_guess. Don't forget to use proper Python indentation!\n",
    "```\n",
    "def get_user_guess():\n",
    "    user_guess = raw_input(\"Guess a number: \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t6. By default, using raw_input alone will store the user's input as a string. Since the user is guessing a whole number, we will need an integer, not a string. This can be accomplished by wrapping the raw_input(\"Guess a number: \") part of your code with int().\n",
    "```\n",
    "def get_user_guess():\n",
    "    user_guess = int(raw_input(\"Guess a number: \"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t7. The name of this function is get_user_guess(), which implies that when the function is called, it should get, or return, the user's guess. On the next line, return the user's guess.\n",
    "\t8. Great! This function is complete and we will use it later to complete our entire program. Now it's time to start building the rest of the game. Create a second function called roll_dice().\n",
    "\t9. Let's give the user the freedom to specify the number of sides that a single die will have. Modify the function to include a parameter called number_of_sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t10. Perfect! The roll_dice function will be used to simulate the rolling of a pair of dice. A single die can land on any value, but we know its value will be at least 1 and be no greater than the number of sides on that die. Inside of the function, let's simulate the first die roll. Use the randint function that you imported earlier to generate a random integer between 1 and number_of_sides. This is how the randint function works. Set the result equal to a variable called first_roll.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def roll_dice(number_of_sides):\n",
    "    first_roll = randint(1, number_of_sides)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t11. On the next line, simulate the second roll. Your line of code will look identical to the line of code you wrote in Step 12, except this time, set the result equal to a variable called second_roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t12. Now let's calculate the maximum value the program can possibly roll. This will help us set some rules for our game later. On the next line, create a variable called max_val and set it equal to number_of_sides times 2 (since there are two die).\n",
    "\t13. On the next line, let the user know what the maximum possible value is by using the print command and a message. You can concatenate the message and the value of max_val. Remember, max_val is an integer, so you will have to explicitly convert it to a string by wrapping it with str() when you concatenate.\n",
    "\t14. On the next line, sleep the program for 1 second.\n",
    "\t15. On the next line, call the get_user_guess function. Remember that the function will return the user's guess after prompting the user. Store the returned value into a variable called user_guess.\n",
    "\t16. Great! We have written code that simulates a dice roll and asks the user for their guess. Now it's time to write the rules that will determine the winner of the game. But what if the user guesses a number that's larger than the total possible value of the dice roll? That shouldn't be allowed... On the next line, write an if statement that checks if the user's guess is greater than the maximum value.\n",
    "\t17. Within the if block, let the user know that their guess is invalid by printing an appropriate message. On the following line, use the return keyword to exit the if block and terminate the program if this condition is met.\n",
    "\t18. Otherwise, the user can proceed to play the game! Add to the if statement by starting an else block. Inside of the else block, first print the message Rolling... to the user.\n",
    "\t19. Staying inside the else block, sleep the program for 2 seconds on the next line to simulate the dice rolling.\n",
    "\t20. On the next line, use string formatting to print the first roll. Remember that you stored the first roll in a variable earlier. This time, don't use %s, but use %d. Note that %s is used to format string variables, while %d is used to format integers. Then, on the next line, sleep the program for 1 second.\n",
    "\t21. On the next line, print the value of the second roll. On the line after that, sleep the program again for 1 second.\n",
    "\t22. To determine a winner, we will need to use the total value of the dice roll. On the next line, create a variable called total_roll and set it equal to the sum of the first roll and the second roll.\n",
    "\t23. On the next line, print the total roll to the user, similar to what you did in Step 21. On the following line, print Result... to the user. Directly after that, sleep the program for 1 second to build suspense!\n",
    "\t24. Keeping inside of the else block, add an if statement checks if the user's guess is greater than the total roll. If it is, print a friendly message to the user informing them that they won. Then, return on the next line.\n",
    "\t25. What if the user's guess is less than the total roll? Inside of an else block, print a message to the user informing them that they lost. Then, return on the next line.\n",
    "\t26. Great! We're almost done! For this program to run, we have to call the function. Somewhere outside of the roll_dice function, call the roll_dice function. Make sure to specify the number of sides a single die has as the parameter!\n",
